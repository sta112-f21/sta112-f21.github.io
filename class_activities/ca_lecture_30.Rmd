## Survival on the Titanic

On April 15, 1912 the RMS *Titanic* sank after colliding with an iceberg, and hundreds of passengers aboard died in the disaster. As dramatized in the movie *Titanic*, the odds of survival were much better for first-class passengers (the richest on board) than for second and third class passengers.

Here we have data on 891 *Titanic* passengers, showing survival by class.

| | First class | Second and third class | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Survived | 136 | 206 | 342 |
| Did not survive | 80 | 469 | 549 |
| Total | 216 | 675 | 891 |

1. What fraction of first-class passengers survived?

2. What were the odds of survival for first-class passengers?

3. What were the odds of survival for second and third class passengers?

4. Calculate the odds ratio comparing odds of survival for first-class passengers to odds of survival for second and third class passengers.

## GPA and med school acceptance

The estimated logistic regression model for the relationship between GPA and acceptance to medical school is

$\log \left( \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}}{1 - \widehat{\pi}} \right) = -19.21 + 5.45 \ \text{GPA},$

where $\widehat{\pi}$ is the estimated probability of acceptance.

5. What is the estimated odds of acceptance for a student with a GPA of 3.0? *(Hint: calculate on the log scale, then exponentiate. Remember that $\log$ here means natural log.)*

6. What is the estimated odds of acceptance for a student with a GPA of 4.0?

7. Calculate the odds ratio comparing odds of acceptance for a student with a GPA of 4.0 to a student with a GPA of 3.0.

8. Calculate the odds ratio comparing odds of acceptance for a student with a GPA of 3.8 to a student with a GPA of 2.8.

9. The estimated slope of the logistic regression model is $\widehat{\beta}_1 = 5.45$. Compare your answers in questions 7 and 8 to $e^{\widehat{\beta}_1}$.
