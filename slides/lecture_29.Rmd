[https://xkcd.com/2533/](https://xkcd.com/2533/)

By "slope hypothesis testing", they mean that they are fitting the model

$\text{exam grade} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{scream loudness} + \varepsilon$

and testing $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ vs. $H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$.

.question[
What are they doing wrong? Which regression assumption is violated?
