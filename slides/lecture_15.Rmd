## Agenda

* HW 4 out today
    * practice writing a data analysis report with the bryozoan data from HW 3
* Today:
    * simple linear regression recap
    * writing a data analysis report
* Next week: Project 1 released. Provided with a dataset and asked to:
    * develop a research question
    * address your research question with simple linear regression
    * write up analysis in report

## Simple linear regression recap

**Model:**

.center[
$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon$
]

where $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2)$, and the $\varepsilon$ are independent from each other.

**Estimated line:**

.center[
$\widehat{y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 x$
]

---

## Fitting the model

.question[
What method do we use to calculate $\widehat{\beta}_0$ and $\widehat{\beta}_1$?
]

--

**Least squares:** minimize $\sum \limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \widehat{y}_i)^2$

---

## Interpretation

.question[
How do I interpret $\widehat{\beta}_0$ and $\widehat{\beta}_1$?
]

--

$\widehat{\beta}_0$: the estimated average value of $y$ when $x = 0$

$\widehat{\beta}_1$: a unit increase in $x$ is associated with a change of $\widehat{\beta}_1$ units in $y$, on average

---

## Inference

Inference with the simple linear regression model:

* Confidence interval for $\beta_1$
* Test hypotheses about $\beta_1$, such as
.center[
$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$

$H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$
]
* Calculate prediction intervals and confidence intervals for the mean response, given $x = x^*$

---

## Assumptions for inference

.question[
What are the six assumptions we need for inference with a regression model?
]

--

* Shape
* Constant variance
* Independence
* Randomness
* Zero mean
* Normality

---

## Diagnostics

.question[
Which diagnostic plots can I use to check the shape, constant variance, and normality assumptions?
]

--

* Shape and constant variance: residual plot
* Normality: quantile-quantile (QQ) plot

---

## Outliers and influential points

.question[
How do I check for potential outliers?
]

--

Studentized residual plot

--

.question[
What do I do if my data has an outlier?
]

--

* If the point is clearly a measurement error: remove it
* Otherwise:
    * If not influential, keep it in data
    * If influential, report results both with and without the point
    
---

## Prediction vs. Inference

**Inference:** Want to understand the relationship between my variables

**Prediction:** Just want to make good predictions

**Assumptions for prediction:** 
* Independence 
* Randomness -- need to generalize predictions to new data
* Shape (sort of) -- don't have to get shape exactly right, but need to be roughly correct for predictions to be useful

Constant variance and normality aren't necessary, but predictions can be better if more assumptions are met.

## The modeling process

## The modeling process

* **Choose:** specify the model, usually based on exploratory data analysis. Examples:
    * $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon$
    * $\sqrt{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon$
* **Fit:** Fit the model in R
    * `lm(... ~ ..., data = ...)`
    * $\widehat{y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 x$
* **Assess:** check assumptions and outliers
    * Residual plots, QQ plots, Studentized residuals
* **Use:** use the final model to answer your research question
    * predictions
    * interpretation of $\widehat{\beta}_1$
    * confidence interval for $\beta_1$
    * p-value for hypotheses about $\beta_1$
    * prediction interval for response
    * confidence interval for mean response

## Data analysis reports

* **Goal:** communicate results of data analysis to an audience
* Many potential formats and audiences
* In this course:
    * Audience: someone familiar with statistics, but not necessarily with the research question or data
    * Format: IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion)

## HW 4

[https://sta112-f21.github.io/homework/homework_4.html](https://sta112-f21.github.io/homework/homework_4.html)

* write a data analysis report using the bryozoan data and your analysis from HW 3
* **Research question:** are larger organisms more energy efficient, proportional to body size?
